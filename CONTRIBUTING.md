# Contributing

This is to serve as a guide to contributing to the project. Feel free to change this if needed.

## Issues
Issues will be used to keep track of what has to be accomplished and known bugs. Suggested changes or bugs can be discussed there.

## Adding a feature
When implementing a feature, let's try keeping unfinished features in their own branches like [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow/). So let's avoid committing directly to master so that we don't break whatever stable code we have at the time.

As for pull requests, for now anyone can merge the requests (other than the person who made the request).

Also, test before pushing.   

If an error occurs while pushing, try pulling first.

## Bugs
When a bug is found in code, open an Issue so that it can be discussed (if needed). Once a the Issue is resolved, close it.
